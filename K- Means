K- Means Clustering Technique using R and finding ways to analyze the optimal number of Clusters.

To perform K- Means Clustering algorithm I have taken the data set from UCI
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ser+Knowledge+Modeling+Data+%28Students%27+Knowledge+Levels+on+DC+Electrical+Machines%29

Dataset Description:
This data measures studentsâ€™ knowledge of a topic in Electrical Engineering. The attribute definitions are as follows:
STG (The degree of study time for goal object materials), (input value) 
SCG (The degree of repetition number of user for goal object materials) (input value) 
STR (The degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object) (input value) 
LPR (The exam performance of user for related objects with goal object) (input value) 
PEG (The exam performance of user for goal objects) (input value)

Problem Statement:
To discover how many clusters, appear to be reasonable for this data; this would be useful, for example, if we wanted to try to build a classification model for knowledge level and we needed to assign a knowledge level to the individual sample.
